Introduction
------------

Flask-Admin is a batteries-included, simple-to-use `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_ extension that lets you
add admin interfaces to Flask applications. It is inspired by the *django-admin* package, but implemented in such
a way that the developer has total control of the look, feel and functionality of the resulting application.

Out-of-the-box, Flask-Admin plays nicely with various ORM's, including

- `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,

- `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_,

- `pymongo <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/>`_ and

- `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_.

It also boasts a simple file management interface and a `redis client <http://redis.io/>`_ console.

The biggest feature of Flask-Admin is flexibility. It aims to provide a set of simple tools that can be used for
building admin interfaces of any complexity. So, to start off with you can create a very simple application in no time,
with auto-generated CRUD-views for each of your models. But then you can go further and customize those views & forms
as the need arises.

Flask-Admin is an active project, well-tested and production ready.

Examples
--------
Several usage examples are included in the */examples* folder. Please add your own, or improve
on the existing examples, and submit a *pull-request*.

To run the examples in your local environment::

  1. Clone the repository::

        git clone https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin.git
        cd flask-admin

  2. Create and activate a virtual environment::

        virtualenv env -p python3
        source env/bin/activate

  3. Install requirements::

        pip install -r examples/sqla/requirements.txt

  4. Run the application::

        python examples/sqla/run_server.py

Documentation
-------------
Flask-Admin is extensively documented, you can find all of the documentation at `https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

The docs are auto-generated from the *.rst* files in the */doc* folder. So if you come across any errors, or
if you think of anything else that should be included, then please make the changes and submit them as a *pull-request*.

To build the docs in your local environment, from the project directory::

    tox -e docs-html

And if you want to preview any *.rst* snippets that you may want to contribute, go to `http://rst.ninjs.org/ <http://rst.ninjs.org/>`_.

Installation
------------
To install Flask-Admin, simply::

    pip install flask-admin

Or alternatively, you can download the repository and install manually by doing::

    git clone git@github.com:flask-admin/flask-admin.git
    cd flask-admin
    python setup.py install

Tests
-----
Test are run with *pytest*. If you are not familiar with this package you can get some more info from `their website <https://pytest.org/>`_.

To run the tests, from the project directory, simply::

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    pytest

You should see output similar to::

    .............................................
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 102 tests in 13.132s

    OK

For all the tests to pass successfully, you'll need Postgres & MongoDB to be running locally. For Postgres::

    > psql postgres
    CREATE DATABASE flask_admin_test;
    \q

    > psql flask_admin_test
    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
    CREATE EXTENSION hstore;

You can also run the tests on multiple environments using *tox*.

3rd Party Stuff
---------------

Flask-Admin is built with the help of `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_,  `Select2 <https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2>`_
and `Bootswatch <http://bootswatch.com/>`_.

If you want to localize your application, install the `Flask-BabelEx <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-BabelEx>`_ package.

You can help improve Flask-Admin's translations through Crowdin: https://crowdin.com/project/flask-admin
